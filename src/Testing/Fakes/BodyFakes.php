/**
 * The query and action fakes: hand it to the application as its StandIns,
 * as MailFake is handed in as its transport, and a closure installed here
 * answers in place of a query's or an action's body.
 *
 * "`Query::fake(RackStats::class, fn () => ...)` and `Action::fake(...)`
 * isolate a page from its data." A test installs one with Tinvar\Testing\Query
 * and Tinvar\Testing\Action, by class or name, or here by name. It is asked
 * by the application's own runners -- the render's, the framework Kernel's
 * for actions and HTTP queries, and the testing Client's for direct calls --
 * so a fake answers a page test, a render and a direct call alike, and only
 * once the call has passed everything before its body.
 *
 * A fake is handed the arguments it names, as the body would have been: a
 * query's resolved models and values, an action's models, form requests,
 * uploads and scalars. `fn () => ...` names none, and is handed none.
 *
 * Emptied between tests by Testing::forget() and Testing::use(), so one
 * test's fake cannot answer the next one's call even where an application
 * outlives a test. Refused unless the environment says this is a test's or
 * a developer's machine, as the testing Client is (ADR 0213).
