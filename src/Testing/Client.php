/**
 * Who a test is, and what it asks the application for.
 *
 * Immutable: actingAs(), asTenant() and the rest return a new client, so a
 * test that signs in for one call has not signed in for the next, and two
 * clients never share a user by accident.
 *
 * Three kinds of call, the spec's layers:
 *
 *   - get() and navigate(): a page through the whole PHP request path --
 *     global and route middleware, the panel's stack, every #[Authorize],
 *     each loader -- stopping where the renderer would start, with the data
 *     it would have been handed recorded instead (PageResponse).
 *   - render(): the same request through the application's real renderer
 *     (RenderedPage), from the renderer pool.
 *   - query() and action(): an entry point called in PHP, without the
 *     transport: no session, CSRF or throttle, everything from model
 *     resolution on as a real call meets it.
 *
 * A page request is a browser's, so it is someone only through the session
 * the application makes for them (TestableApplication::signedIn()), and is
 * in whichever tenant and panel its route declares. A direct call is made
 * in PHP, so the user, tenant and panel are entered around it, as a job's
 * are.
